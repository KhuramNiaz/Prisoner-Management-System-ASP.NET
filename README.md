# Prisoner-Management-System-ASP.NET
The motive of the project is to provide a system which allows management of prisoners in an efficient and effective manner. The system enables a jail officer to manage prisoners and their records. In addition, a court officer looks for the well-being of prisoners and manages their complaints. Moreover, a Jail officer is responsible for the approval/disapproval of transfer of prisoners from one prison to another upon the orders of court.
